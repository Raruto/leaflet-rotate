**Side notes:**

Be aware that this is a proof of concept that shows how to alter the core leaflet library and make rotation feature usable as a standalone plugin. Check out fnicollet's [rotate-master](https://github.com/fnicollet/Leaflet/tree/rotate-master) branch if you prefer to use a reliable all-in-one solution.
